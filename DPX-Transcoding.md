# DPX transcoding via FFmpeg

## Overview
While UW prefers MKV/FFV1 film preservation files to be created via the [RAWCooked](https://mediaarea.net/RAWcooked) tool by [MediaArea](https://mediaarea.net/), this isn't always possible or practical depending on the nature of the project. In this case, [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) may be used to compress DPX stacks into the necessary FFV1/Matroska files.
